Simple, dumb drinking game, based on randomly selecting a player to drink at a random interval, with annoying blinking, sounds, and dumb text-to-speech.

Previously horribly written in plain JS (+ a drizzle of jQuery), now (still horribly written as I don't know it yet) solid-js!

Invite your friends, have them type in their name and see who comes out alive.
