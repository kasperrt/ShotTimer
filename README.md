# ShotTimer


Its a shottimer.

You type your name in the box (needs to be atleast two entered), and when two or more is added, the timer starts.

When the timer hits zero, a random name is picked out, and a sound is played + the site blinks like crazy.

When navigating to the site, anyone can join the game by using their phone, and navigate to the URL under the QR code or scan the QR code. The user can then type in their desired name, and draw a drawing to easily separate themselves with the other players.
